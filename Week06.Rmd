DOCUMENT CLUSTERING WITH DAILY KOS

Document clustering, or text clustering, is a very popular application of clustering algorithms. A web search engine, like Google, often returns thousands of results for a simple query. For example, if you type the search term "jaguar" into Google, around 200 million results are returned. This makes it very difficult to browse or find relevant information, especially if the search term has multiple meanings. If we search for "jaguar", we might be looking for information about the animal, the car, or the Jacksonville Jaguars football team. 

Clustering methods can be used to automatically group search results into categories, making it easier to find relavent results. This method is used in the search engines PolyMeta and Helioid, as well as on FirstGov.gov, the official Web portal for the U.S. government. The two most common algorithms used for document clustering are Hierarchical and k-means. 

In this problem, we'll be clustering articles published on Daily Kos, an American political blog that publishes news and opinion articles written from a progressive point of view. Daily Kos was founded by Markos Moulitsas in 2002, and as of September 2014, the site had an average weekday traffic of hundreds of thousands of visits. 

The file dailykos.csv contains data on 3,430 news articles or blogs that have been posted on Daily Kos. These articles were posted in 2004, leading up to the United States Presidential Election. The leading candidates were incumbent President George W. Bush (republican) and John Kerry (democratic). Foreign policy was a dominant topic of the election, specifically, the 2003 invasion of Iraq. 

Each of the variables in the dataset is a word that has appeared in at least 50 different articles (1,545 words in total). The set of  words has been trimmed according to some of the techniques covered in the previous week on text analytics (punctuation has been removed, and stop words have been removed). For each document, the variable values are the number of times that word appeared in the document. 

 

Problem 1.1 - Hierarchical Clustering

(1 point possible)
Let's start by building a hierarchical clustering model. First, read the data set into R. Then, compute the distances (using method="euclidean"), and use hclust to build the model (using method="ward.D"). You should cluster on all of the variables.

```{r}
source('../QAR/00_RProj/00_Global/iSynGeneral.R')

dailykos <- fread("https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_3+1T2016+type@asset+block/dailykos.csv")

dailykos <- as.data.frame(dailykos)
# Compute distances
distances <- dist(x = dailykos, method="euclidean")

# Hierarchical clustering
clusterKOS = hclust(distances, method = "ward.D") 

# Plot the dendrogram
plot(clusterKOS)

# Assign points to clusters
clusterGroups = cutree(clusterKOS, k = 7)

spl = split(dailykos, clusterGroups)
lapply(spl, nrow)

tail(sort(colMeans(spl[[1]])))
aw <- function(x){
  tail(sort(colMeans(x)))
}
lapply(spl, aw)
```


Running the dist function will probably take you a while. Why? Select all that apply.

 We have a lot of observations, so it takes a long time to compute the distance between each pair of observations.  We have a lot of variables, so the distance computation is long.  Our variables have a wide range of values, so the distances are more complicated.  The euclidean distance is known to take a long time to compute, regardless of the size of the data.

Let's pick 7 clusters. This number is reasonable according to the dendrogram, and also seems reasonable for the application. Use the cutree function to split your data into 7 clusters.

Now, we don't really want to run tapply on every single variable when we have over 1,000 different variables. Let's instead use the subset function to subset our data by cluster. Create 7 new datasets, each containing the observations from one of the clusters.

Problem 1.5 - Hierarchical Clustering

(1 point possible)
Instead of looking at the average value in each variable individually, we'll just look at the top 6 words in each cluster. To do this for cluster 1, type the following in your R console (where "HierCluster1" should be replaced with the name of your first cluster subset):

tail(sort(colMeans(HierCluster1)))

This computes the mean frequency values of each of the words in cluster 1, and then outputs the 6 words that occur the most frequently. The colMeans function computes the column (word) means, the sort function orders the words in increasing order of the mean values, and the tail function outputs the last 6 words listed, which are the ones with the largest column means.

What is the most frequent word in this cluster, in terms of average value? Enter the word exactly how you see it in the output:

MARKET SEGMENTATION FOR AIRLINES

Market segmentation is a strategy that divides a broad target market of customers into smaller, more similar groups, and then designs a marketing strategy specifically for each group. Clustering is a common technique for market segmentation since it automatically finds similar groups given a data set. 

In this problem, we'll see how clustering can be used to find similar groups of customers who belong to an airline's frequent flyer program. The airline is trying to learn more about its customers so that it can target different customer segments with different types of mileage offers. 

The file AirlinesCluster.csv contains information on 3,999 members of the frequent flyer program. This data comes from the textbook "Data Mining for Business Intelligence," by Galit Shmueli, Nitin R. Patel, and Peter C. Bruce. For more information, see the website for the book.

There are seven different variables in the dataset, described below:

Balance = number of miles eligible for award travel
QualMiles = number of miles qualifying for TopFlight status
BonusMiles = number of miles earned from non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months
BonusTrans = number of non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months
FlightMiles = number of flight miles in the past 12 months
FlightTrans = number of flight transactions in the past 12 months
DaysSinceEnroll = number of days since enrolled in the frequent flyer program
Problem 1.1 - Normalizing the Data

(2 points possible)
Read the dataset AirlinesCluster.csv into R and call it "airlines".

```{r}
airlines <- as.data.frame(fread("https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_3+1T2016+type@asset+block/AirlinesCluster.csv"))

summary(airlines)

```

Looking at the summary of airlines, which TWO variables have (on average) the smallest values?

Problem 1.2 - Normalizing the Data

(1 point possible)
In this problem, we will normalize our data before we run the clustering algorithms. Why is it important to normalize the data before clustering?

 If we don't normalize the data, the clustering algorithms will not work (we will get an error in R).  If we don't normalize the data, it will be hard to interpret the results of the clustering.  If we don't normalize the data, the clustering will be dominated by the variables that are on a larger scale.  If we don't normalize the data, the clustering will be dominated by the variables that are on a smaller scale.

Problem 1.3 - Normalizing the Data

(2 points possible)
Let's go ahead and normalize our data. You can normalize the variables in a data frame by using the preProcess function in the "caret" package. You should already have this package installed from Week 4, but if not, go ahead and install it with install.packages("caret"). Then load the package with library(caret).

```{r}
install.packages("caret")
install.packages("pbkrtest")
library(caret)

preproc = preProcess(airlines)

airlinesNorm = predict(preproc, airlines)

```

Now, create a normalized data frame called "airlinesNorm" by running the following commands:

preproc = preProcess(airlines)

airlinesNorm = predict(preproc, airlines)

The first command pre-processes the data, and the second command performs the normalization. If you look at the summary of airlinesNorm, you should see that all of the variables now have mean zero. You can also see that each of the variables has standard deviation 1 by using the sd() function.

In the normalized data, which variable has the largest maximum value?

 Balance  QualMiles  BonusMiles  BonusTrans  FlightMiles  FlightTrans  DaysSinceEnroll
- This answer is unanswered.

Problem 2.1 - Hierarchical Clustering

(1 point possible)
Compute the distances between data points (using euclidean distance) and then run the Hierarchical clustering algorithm (using method="ward.D") on the normalized data. It may take a few minutes for the commands to finish since the dataset has a large number of observations for hierarchical clustering.

Then, plot the dendrogram of the hierarchical clustering process. Suppose the airline is looking for somewhere between 2 and 10 clusters. According to the dendrogram, which of the following is NOT a good choice for the number of clusters?

Problem 2.3 - Hierarchical Clustering

(2 points possible)
Now, use tapply to compare the average values in each of the variables for the 5 clusters (the centroids of the clusters). You may want to compute the average values of the unnormalized data so that it is easier to interpret. You can do this for the variable "Balance" with the following command:

tapply(airlines$Balance, clusterGroups, mean)

Problem 3.2 - K-Means Clustering

(1 point possible)
Now, compare the cluster centroids to each other either by dividing the data points into groups and then using tapply, or by looking at the output of kmeansClust$centers, where "kmeansClust" is the name of the output of the kmeans function. (Note that the output of kmeansClust$centers will be for the normalized data. If you want to look at the average values for the unnormalized data, you need to use tapply like we did for hierarchical clustering.)

Do you expect Cluster 1 of the K-Means clustering output to necessarily be similar to Cluster 1 of the Hierarchical clustering output?

 Yes, because the clusters are displayed in order of size, so the largest cluster will always be first.  Yes, because the clusters are displayed according to the properties of the centroid, so the cluster order will be similar.  No, because cluster ordering is not meaningful in either k-means clustering or hierarchical clustering.  No, because the clusters produced by the k-means algorithm will never be similar to the clusters produced by the Hierarchical algorithm.
